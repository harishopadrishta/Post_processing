# Post_processing
- These files are used to:
1. Calculate averages of first and second order turbulent statistics.
2. Calculate error norms for comparing the accuracy of LBM models while simulating laminar flow; make movies as to how certain quantities evolve.
3. Plot contour and vector plot ; RMS and mean velocity profiles; Reynolds stress profiles of turbulent and laminar simulation data.
4. Post-processing and writing data to files according (for further use by NCL scripts to create plots).
- These scripts are written using Matlab and NCL (official NCAR command language for creating plots and graphics).
